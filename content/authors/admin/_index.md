I am a 16 year old student from Hwa Chong Institution (Singapore). I just graduated from the high school and is joining Junior College next year. I made this website cos ppl around started doing theirs so why not :). I like physics and math and programming is one of my new-found interest although I hated it initially because dumb me thought it was useless.
